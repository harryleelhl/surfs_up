1. During the summertime, June had a mean temperature of 74.9 whereas December had a mean temperature of 71, which is in the winter. The temperature stayed between 73 and 77 degrees for half of the month

2. June had a count of 1700 temperatures whereas December only had a count of 1517 temperatures

3. December had a standard deviation of 3.745 while June had a standard deviation of 3.257, showing that December had a larger spread of different temperatures.
